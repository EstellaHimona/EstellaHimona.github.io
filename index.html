      <h3>Estella Himona</h3>
      <p> Dear visitors of this website,
      	My name is Estella (as you can see above), I am from Cyprus and in my free time I love playing the piano! 
      	I am 18 years old; just finished school :). My favourite past-time is watching makeup video tutorials and then experiment new trends on my face. However my mum and sister have found and they cannot resist asking me to do their makeup aswell :/</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Illusion scene</h3>
    <p>
	So now it's time to show you my first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). 
	I created an illusion scene in which circles are fading in and out of the screen, in a certain way so to create something like a maze of circles.
	As you will watch the project running, you will find out that the movement of the cirlces synchronises with the background music I added to the sketch!
	While running this project, it is highly recommended to keep your eyes focused on the white circle which appears in the centre of your screen!!
